= First Section

To add citations to the report, go to https://scholar.google.com, search for a paper, click on the quotation mark icon below the search result, and copy the BibTeX entry. Then paste it into the `refs.bib` file. You can cite papers using the `@` symbol followed by the citation key, e.g., @lowry1951protein.

Other options to get BibTeX entries for your references include https://www.bibtex.com/converters/ and asking ChatGPT to generate the a BibTeX entry for you. (If you use ChatGPT, make sure to verify the generated BibTeX entry for correctness.)

More information about citations can be found in the Typst documentation: https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/cite.

== First Subsection

To add figures to your report, save the image file in the `figures` folder and use the `#figure` command as shown below to include it in your document. You can specify the width of the image and add a caption. Then you can reference the figure like this: @proofread.

#figure(
  image("figures/proof-read.png", width: 80%),
  caption: [A humble request. (Copyright: University of the Fraser Valley.)],
) <proofread>

=== First Subsubsection

You can make sub, sub-sub, and sub-sub-sub sections by adding `=` signs in front of the section title. There needs to be a space between the last `=` sign and the title text.

= Second Section

You can add tables using the `#table` command. Here is an example table:

#figure(
  caption: [Example Table],
  table(
    columns: (auto, auto, auto),
    table.header([*Column 1*], [*Column 2*], [*Column 3*]),
    "Row 1", "Data 1", [Data 2],
    image("figures/proof-read.png", width: 40%), "Data 3", "Data 4",
  ),
) <table-example>

You can reference the table like this: @table-example.

== Various Text Formatting Options

You can make text _italic_ by surrounding it with `_` symbols, *bold* by surrounding it with `*` symbols, and _*bold italic*_ by combining both. You can also use `#code` to format inline code snippets.

You can create bullet point lists using `-` or `*` symbols:
- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
  - Sub bullet point 1
  - Sub bullet point 2


You can create numbered lists using numbers followed by a period:
1. First item
2. Second item
  1. Sub item 1
  2. Sub item 2



== Equations

You can create equations using `$` symbols. For example, you can make an inline equation like this $E=m c^2$ or a displayed equation like this:

$ x < y => x gt.eq.not y $ <eq1>

You can reference the equation like this: Eq. @eq1.
